# Library-Management-System-CPP
Library Management System is a very simple mini project in C++, built as a console application without using graphics features. 
Itâ€™s just a demonstration of the use of file handling and stream class in C++ language.
This a project that helped me grasp the basic information about c++ and its dfferent types of streams.
